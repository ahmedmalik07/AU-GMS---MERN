# FGMS Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Route Structure**: Fixed backend routes to match frontend expectations
2. **API Endpoints**: Corrected member creation and attendance marking endpoints
3. **Data Persistence**: Fixed member model to allow proper querying
4. **Authentication**: Improved JWT handling and error responses

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fgms
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_in_production
   PORT=4000
   NODE_ENV=development
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start MongoDB (make sure MongoDB is running on your system)

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd fgms
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
- Fixed route structure in `index.js` to properly mount routes under `/api`
- Updated `members.js` route to handle POST requests correctly
- Fixed `attendance.js` route to match frontend expectations
- Removed automatic filtering of inactive members in Member model
- Improved error handling and response structure

### Frontend Changes:
- Updated `MemberContext.jsx` to handle corrected API responses
- Fixed data fetching and state management
- Improved error handling for API calls

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Registration**: Try registering a new admin user
2. **Login**: Login with the registered credentials
3. **Member Management**: Add, edit, and delete members
4. **Attendance**: Mark attendance for members
5. **Data Persistence**: Verify that data is saved and persists after page refresh

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
2. **Port Conflicts**: Make sure ports 4000 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) are available
3. **CORS Issues**: Check that the CORS configuration matches your frontend URL
4. **JWT Issues**: Verify the JWT_SECRET is set in the .env file

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/members` - Get all members
- `POST /api/members` - Create new member
- `PUT /api/members/:id` - Update member
- `DELETE /api/members/:id` - Delete member
- `POST /api/attendance` - Mark attendance
